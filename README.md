This is an assignment in the course which helps in applying the understanding on version control with Git in Software Engineering. Git hub is a toold which is essential for managing the source code in projects and facilitates collaboration among the team members. It helps throughout the overall development process by helping in tracking changes, reverting and merging the code by multiple individuals in a team. Firstly, we go through the commit command by which we mark and save the specific part of code.

We would got through more detila about the Git Commit in this paragraph. Firstly, we need to move the changes made to any files to staged area using the command (git add) and then the staged code can be commited using the command (git commit). We can use the -m flag followed by a message directly in the command line, like git commit -m "User Acceptance bug fix".

We need to make sure that the commit message is clear and elaborative so that it helps the developers in understanding the purpose of the commit when reviewing the project's history to make further changes.
